    Napoleon Bonaparte was a French military general and emperor who 
    rose to prominence during the French Revolution and
    conquered much of Europe in the early 19th century.
    He served as First Consul and was crowned the first
    emperor of France in 1804. Known for his military
    genius, he is also remembered for the Napoleonic Code and his ultimate
    defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, which led to his exile and death at age 51.

    The breakdown of the Treaty of Amiens led to the War of the Third Coalition by 1805.
    Napoleon shattered the coalition with a decisive victory at the Battle
    of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire.
    In the War of the Fourth Coalition, Napoleon defeated Prussia at the
    Battle of Jena–Auerstedt in 1806, marched his Grande Armée into 
    Europe, and defeated the Russians in 1807 at the Battle of Friedland.
    Seeking to extend his trade embargo against Britain, Napoleon 
    invaded the Iberian Peninsula and installed his brother Joseph as 
    King of Spain in 1808, provoking the Peninsular War. In 1809 the
    Austrians again challenged France in the War of the Fifth Coalition
    in which Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after winning 
    the Battle of Wagram. In the summer of 1812 he launched an invasion
    of Russia, briefly occupying Moscow before conducting a catastro
    phic retreat of his army that winter. In 1813 Prussia and Austria 
    joined Russia in the War of the Sixth Coalition, in which Napoleon
    was decisively defeated at the Battle of Leipzig. The coalition 
    invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in
    April 1814. They exiled him to the Mediterranean island of Elba 
    and restored the Bourbons to power. Ten months later, Napoleon 
    escaped from Elba on a brig, landed in France with a thousand men
    and marched on Paris, again taking control of the country. His
    opponents responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which 
    defeated him at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. Napoleon was 
    exiled to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic
    where he died of stomach cancer in 1821, aged 51.
